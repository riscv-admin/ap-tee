# AP-TEE Task Group

This repository represents an administrative repository for the AP-TEE Task Group.  
It should contain documents to facilitate the group function, e.g. meeting minutes and supporting documents.
It should not contain code nor specifications.

The AP-TEE charter is [here](https://github.com/riscv-admin/ap-tee/blob/main/CHARTER.md), and the non-ISA specifications are hosted [here](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-ap-tee).
